# This is where I will put some research that I do on our data set so we understand what the obreviations mean, important columns, etc.

# Feature Areas: 
### 0. EEG_sleep_score (1, 4039)
  - Also known as electroencephalogram which is electrical activity of the brain. EEG recordings show that the stages of sleep reverse to reach a quite different state called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep.
### 1. FFA (1, 4039)
  - Also known as fusiform face area
### 2. HVC (1, 4039)
  - Also known as higher visual cortex
### 3. LOC (1, 4039)
  - Also known as lateral occipital complex
### 4. LVC (1, 4039)
  - Also known as lower visual cortex
### 5. PPA (1, 4039)
  - Also known as parahippocampal place area
### 6. V1 (1, 4039)
  - Combined with V2 and V3 to make LVC
### 7. V2 (1, 4039)
  - Combined with V1 and V3 to make LVC
### 8. V3 (1, 4039)
  - Combined with V1 and V2 to make LVC
