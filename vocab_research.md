#This is where I will put some research that I do on our data set so we understand what the obreviations mean, important columns, etc.

##Column header names: 
0 EEG_sleep_score (1, 4039)  --  b'0 = not voxelData, 1 = voxelData'
- Also known as electroencephalogram which is electrical activity of the brain. EEG recordings show that the stages of sleep reverse to reach a quite different state called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep.
1 FFA (1, 4039)  --  b'Value = X coordinate'
- Also known as fusiform face area
2 HVC (1, 4039)  --  b'Value = Y coordinate'
- Also known as higher visual cortex
3 LOC (1, 4039)  --  b'Value = Z coordinate'
- Also known as lateral occipital complex
4 LVC (1, 4039)  --  b'0 = not FFA voxel, 1 = FFA voxel'
- Also known as lower visual cortex
5 PPA (1, 4039)  --  b'0 = not HVC voxel, 1 = HVC voxel'
- Also known as parahippocampal place area
